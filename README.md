## HOW DOES SOCIAL MEDIA AFFECT MY SLEEP?  

**Sabancı University DSA210 Introduction to Data Science Course**  
**Fall 2024-2025 Term Project**  

Hi, my name is **Umut Can Çubukçu (Student ID: 32453)**.  
For my project, I will analyze step count data and compare it based on whether it was a matchday for the team I support or not.

### MOTIVATION  
### **MOTIVATION**  
I am passionate about understanding how my emotions and interests influence my daily habits. Matchdays for the team I support bring a unique mix of excitement and anticipation, and the outcome of these matches,whether a win, loss, or draw can further amplify or dampen these feelings. This project aims to explore whether the emotional highs and lows associated with matchdays and their results have a measurable impact on my physical activity, as reflected in my step count data. By analyzing these patterns, I hope to gain insights into how emotionally charged events shape my behavior and routine.
