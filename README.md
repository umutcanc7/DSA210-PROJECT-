# DSA210 Project - Umut Can Çubukçu  
## HOW DOES SOCIAL MEDIA AFFECT MY SLEEP?  

**Sabancı University DSA210 Introduction to Data Science Course**  
**Fall 2024-2025 Term Project**  

Hi, my name is **Umut Can Çubukçu (Student ID: 32453)**.  
For my project, I will analyze step count data and compare it based on whether it was a matchday for the team I support or not.  

---

### MOTIVATION  
I watch all the matches of the team I support, and I usually get extra excited on matchdays. I am curious whether this excitement leads to increased activity in my daily life. To explore this, I decided to track and analyze my daily step count.

### PLAN  
- **This week**: Submit requests to Apple Inc. and Google to begin extracting data.  
- **Around December 14**: Start writing code and visualizing findings.  
- **Two weeks before the final week**: Continue refining code and visualizations.  
- **January 8**: Final review before submission deadline.

### DATA SOURCE  
I will collect step count data from my mobile phone's health app and gather matchday information using Google.
