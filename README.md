# DSA210-PROJECT- UMUT CAN CUBUKCU
HOW DOES SOCIAL MEDIA AFFECT MY SLEEP?
Sabancı University DSA210 Introduction to Data Science Course
Fall 2024-2025 Term Project

Hi, my name is Umut Can Çubukçu (Student ID: 32453).
For my project, I will analyze step count data from my mobile phone and compare it based on whether it was a matchday for the team I support or not.

**MOTIVATION**
I watch all the matches of the team I support, and I usually get extra excited on matchdays. I am curious whether this excitement leads to increased activity in my daily life. To explore this, I decided to track and analyze my daily step count.

*PLAN*
İn this wee, i will send request to Apple İNC. and google to start to extract data.
Around 14 Dec  i will start to write my code  and visualize my foundings  in 2 wee before final wee.
Last chec on 8 January, before the last day of submission.

DATA SOURCE
I will collect step count data from my mobile phone's health app and gather matchday information using Google.
