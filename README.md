# DSA210 Project - Umut Can Çubukçu  
## HOW DOES SOCIAL MEDIA AFFECT MY SLEEP?  

**Sabancı University DSA210 Introduction to Data Science Course**  
**Fall 2024-2025 Term Project**  

Hi, my name is **Umut Can Çubukçu (Student ID: 32453)**.  
My project focuses on analyzing my daily step count data to explore how matchdays for the team I support, along with the outcomes of those matches, influence my physical activity levels compared to non-matchdays.

### MOTIVATION  
### **MOTIVATION**  
I am passionate about understanding how my emotions and interests influence my daily habits. Matchdays for the team I support bring a unique mix of excitement and anticipation, and the outcome of these matches,whether a win, loss, or draw can further amplify or dampen these feelings. This project aims to explore whether the emotional highs and lows associated with matchdays and their results have a measurable impact on my physical activity, as reflected in my step count data. By analyzing these patterns, I hope to gain insights into how emotionally charged events shape my behavior and routine.

### PLAN  
- **This week**: Submit requests to Apple Inc. and Google to begin extracting data.  
- **Around December 14**: Start writing code and visualizing findings.
- **Before Final Wee**:Adding newly gathered data to project.  
- **January 8**: Final review before submission deadline.

The dataset contains match-related information for a football team, structured in a table format. It includes variables such as:  

- **Date:** The date each match took place.  
- **Match Results:** The outcome of each match, represented as the final score (e.g., "3:4" or "1:0").  

Additional details in the dataset include:  
- **Competition Type:** Whether the match was part of a league or an international tournament (e.g., UEFA Champions League, Süper Lig).  
- **Opponent Team:** The name of the opposing team.  
- **Venue:** Indicates whether the match was played at home or away.  
- **Attendance Numbers:** The number of spectators at each match.  
- **Formation:** The tactical setup used during the match (e.g., "4-2-3-1").  

For this project, I will primarily focus on the **Date** and **Match Results** columns to examine the relationship between matchdays, match outcomes, and my daily step count data.
.İ will parse the HTML page for a match and collect the date and match result.
